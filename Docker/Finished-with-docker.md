# Finished with docker.

## Why I learned docker.

- for my personal interest.
- for the Chinese Artificial Intelligence Competition.

## State of mastering this skill.

- know the basic structure of docker and do corresponding exercise of each part.
- successfully applying the docker technique in Chinese Artificial Intelligence Competition as the Competition required.

## Plan for the next step.

    Normally I don't need to use this technique in my work, but I can still dockerize my algorithms for validation/test/comparison. As for now, I need to go to the next topic `Shell`, I think I will go deeper about this skill as needed, so far so good. See you in Shell.
